# YAML documents begin with the document separator ---

# The minus in YAML this indicates a list item.  The playbook contains a list 
# of plays, with each play being a dictionary
-

  # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with

  # Variable: variables that will apply to the play, on all target systems

  # Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
  # can also be used for pre and post tasks

  # Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task

  # Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play

# Three dots indicate the end of a YAML document
#
We can make use of this language to store data and configuration in a human-readable format.
	YAML files will have .yml as an extension
